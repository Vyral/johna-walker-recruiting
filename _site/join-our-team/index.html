<p>Dear Real Estate Agent,</p>

<p>Are you a highly experienced agent or the type who will work their hardest, even as a rookie? </p>

<p>If you’re struggling in the real estate business it may be because you cannot get many leads, have trouble converting leads into contracts, lack proper training, and lack income because of that improper training.</p>

<p>To try to succeed in this business, you may make commission deals, profit share, and seek online training. You might join a larger team that’s producing highly, thinking this will be the answer for you. However, they won’t train you and you’ll be directed to a website by a team without an in-house broker to train you in person. A few people on those teams may be high producers, but the team as a whole is not.</p>

<p><strong>You may lose sleep at night because you’re worried about your income, how you’re going to pay all your bills, you're considering getting another job, or you have a second job and aren’t satisfied.</strong> If things continue like this, you may decide to leave the real estate business. We see that happening frequently.</p>

<p>This is why, when creating my own team, I wanted to do things differently. We work with our agents constantly; we teach them to use our systems, offer support, and provide proper training.</p>

<p>My name is Johna Walker, and <strong>the agents on my team often outsell everyone else on our local MLS.</strong> Our agents are averaging 50 transactions per year, while the average agent in our market does six. Our average sale price is also higher than any other team. Our average is $175,000, while our MLS average sale price is $145,000.</p>

<p>Our credibility is our proven track record, our agents do very well in this business. I have agents who make $220,000 per year, that’s a lot of money in our area. We hire many people in military families because it’s very difficult to get a job in that situation. Businesses know you may only be around for 12 to 24 months before moving to the next duty station. We have our showing agent program, which is something you can do for a year or two, it’s a win-win for both of us. Also, 98% of our business is military, so we know what our client’s lives are like and what they need. </p>

<p><strong>I was just like you.</strong> I began in real estate because I was a military spouse and needed money for my kids’ college. When I started my career I cried every night because I wasn’t offered any training, the people I worked for were unpleasant, they didn’t care about their staff, and I had to find other resources for my training if I wanted to do well. </p>

<p><strong>When you join our team, you’ll begin as a showing agent or apprentice and then move up.</strong> You’ll receive proper mentoring and training, and we’ll hold you accountable. This makes a large difference in your career. You need to be on our team and receive support to do that volume of business; <strong>you can’t do it alone.</strong> </p>

<p>I am the only broker in town who does not compete with my agents. I’m here to mentor them and help improve their skill set and professionalism. We’re the only team in town with a showing agent model. The other top team in town doesn’t have an in-house broker to provide training each day. Their broker lives four hours away. </p>

<p>Our office is full of award-winning agents. We have many who have won rookie of the year (including myself), Realtor of the year, and salesperson of the year. <strong>If you work with us, you will be in the top ten agents in the MLS,</strong> period. That’s what happens with our team year after year. </p>

<p>We have daily agent huddles, and that’s often when I provide training. We have plenty of both impromptu training and scheduled mentoring. We help with lead generation, have wonderful SCRM, and high standing on social media where we highlight our team, agents, and properties. </p>

<p>When you work with us, you’ll have more money and time to spend with your loved ones. Many people who make more money have no time to spend it. I’ve created the best of both worlds with my model. When you have the support of a whole team including a transaction coordinator, sales manager, and even the person sitting at the front desk who handles all the small things, you’re able to do the work and also take off the time you need. When I first began making money I had no time to go on vacation or spend time with my family and friends, I wanted to make sure that didn’t happen to those on my team. Sure, many agents in town have free time, but they aren’t making as much money. </p>

<p>You could join another brokerage and sit through tons of webinars for your training. You could work for a franchise that’s always finding little fees you have to pay. Or you could join us, because <strong>you’ll receive in-house training each day from a local, veteran-owned business.</strong> We live here, we love it here, and we’re very involved in our local community. </p>

<p>Don’t just take our word for it. Many of our staff have great stories to share about joining our team. We have team members who were working second jobs at Cracker Barrel, a local Italian restaurant, and UPS while they tried to learn the real estate business on other teams that weren’t helping them enough. One of our current showing agents was working on another team and left them. He reached out, wanting to join us, and now he’s going through our training program and is excited to be learning the business. The other team had simply given him a desk and told him to figure it out by himself. <strong>That’s common in our industry, the sentiment of “figure it out.”</strong> We also have two other agents who are military wives who are making at least three times the average income for our area. </p>

<p><strong>When you first join our team, you’ll make $1,000 the first month while you begin training.</strong> After that, you’ll receive $2,000 as a monthly salary plus 5% commission on all the transactions you assist with. Right after you’re hired, the onboarding process involves two weeks of intense training. You’ll learn our systems, CRM, the software we use, and the basics of our business. After that, you begin job shadowing one of our top agents, someone who is involved with at least 60 transactions per year. The next thing you know, you’ll be making good money. </p>

<p><strong>I guarantee that we work for your best interests and will provide the best training available.</strong></p>

<p>The quicker you get started and put all of this into place, the quicker you’ll start making great money. If this sounds like an opportunity you’d like to take or want to discuss this path further, please reach out to me. It’s time to get started in your successful career! </p>

<p>I hope to hear from you soon.</p>

<p>Johna Walker</p>
